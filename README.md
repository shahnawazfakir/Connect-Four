Welcome to Connect Four Game with Python!

You should Run AI.py file to start the game!

Use the following command to play with another player: connect_four(Player('X'), Player('O'))

Use the following command to play with the computer: connect_four(Player('X'), AIPlayer('O', 'RANDOM', 1))

Note: When playing with the computer, to increase the difficulty of the game, increase the "1" mentioned as an attribute in the command. The higher that number gets in the command, the more difficult the game. Surprisngly, if we have enough processing power, we can set that limit to infinity and create an unbeatable Connect Four player.

HAVE FUN!
